I am an enthusiastic and tenacious professional who thrives in the fast-paced world of architectural engineering. 

I recently graduated from Vancouver Community College achieving a High Distinction CAD & BIM Technician Diploma (4.24 GPA). I also received the Stan Phipps Scholarship, which is awarded to the two top-achieving students in the Architecture Department.

Over the past two years I have specialized in both architectural and civil/structural drafting. My willingness to learn and ability to grasp concepts quickly has enabled me to take briefs and create accurate, buildable, and coordinated designs that support sustainable, human-centered environments. 

I have an extremely flexible attitude to my next career move and am available immediately. I have a 3 year Post Graduation Work Permit and am happy to work in any Canadian Province.
